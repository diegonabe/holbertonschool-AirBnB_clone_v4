# AirBnB Clone - Web Dynamic
This project aims to replicate the functionality and design aesthetics of the popular accommodation rental platform, Airbnb, using HTML, CSS, Flask, and JavaScript. The clone will include features such as user authentication, property listings, search functionality, booking management, and interactive animations to enhance the user experience.

Key Features :) :

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely. Password encryption and session management will be implemented for enhanced security.

Property Listings: Property owners can list their accommodations, providing details such as description, amenities, location, and pricing. Users can browse through these listings and view detailed information about each property.

Search Functionality: A robust search engine will allow users to filter properties based on criteria such as location, price range, amenities, and availability dates. The search results will be displayed in a visually appealing and intuitive manner.

Booking Management: Users can book properties for their desired dates and manage their bookings through a user-friendly interface. Property owners will receive notifications and have the ability to accept or decline booking requests.

Interactive Animations: JavaScript will be utilized to implement interactive animations and transitions throughout the application, enhancing the overall user experience. Smooth scrolling, hover effects, and dynamic content loading will be incorporated to create a visually engaging interface.
